# 🌦️ Random Weather Forecast Generator

This is a fun JavaScript program that generates a random, nonsensical weather forecast every time you run it. It selects one random phrase from each of three arrays to build a unique and entertaining message.

## 📋 Project Objectives

This project was built as part of the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer curriculum. The objectives of this project were the following:
- Building a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locall on your computer

## 🛠️ How It Works

The program is made up of:
- Three arrays containing different types of phrases:
  - `array1`: Time-based intros (e.g., "Today’s forecast")
  - `array2`: Weather conditions (e.g., "fog made of dad jokes")
  - `array3`: Outcomes or instructions (e.g., "don’t forget your inflatable dinosaur suit")
- A loop that randomly selects one element from each array
- A final message that combines all three into a single sentence
