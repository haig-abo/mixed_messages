Project Plan

Message Topic: Unexpected Weather Forecasts

Approach:
- Single array that stores multiple arrays
- Each of those arrays store a series of strings that will be randomly selected and added to the  resulting string

Function structure: single function that indexes each array depending on the random number generated.
